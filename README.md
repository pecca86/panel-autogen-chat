# panel-autogen-chat


## ABOUT

This is a demo project where I have created a chat interface using the Python Panels library in conjunction with AutoGen. AutoGen is a framework that levarages existing LLMs to create agents with different roles. The agents can then communicate with each other, without the help of a human, to solve problems more effechiently.


## REQUIREMENTS

- Python >= 3.10
- AutoGen
